      <h2 class="media-title">Derrick Carter</h2>
       <p><strong>Derrick Carter</strong> (born October 21, 1969) is an American house producer and DJ from Chicago, Illinois. He is regarded as one of the best underground house key players currently active and is particularly popular in Europe.</p>
       <h2>Biography</h2>

<p>Carter was born in Compton, California and raised in the western suburbs of Chicago, IL. After practising his DJ skills for a number of years as a teenager in his bedroom (bedroom jock), he then made the definitive step into the Chicago house scene.
In 1988, he released an EP with Mark Farina and Chris Nazuka as the group Symbols & Instruments. While the record wasn't a huge commercial success, it did have a strong influence on the burgeoning ambient techno movement in England. This established Derrick as an international figure in the underground house scene.</p>
<h2>Later years</h2>
<p>Carter rarely gives extensive interviews and has kept a low profile since his rise to fame. He famously ran a record label named Classic Recordings that (as planned ten years before) ceased to exist after its hundredth release. The 12"es start at CMC100 and run backwards, the LP's & CD's start at CMC100 and run forwards. Above all, Derrick is still respected by some as one of the best house music DJs in the world. His dj-sets are firmly rooted in black music of the 1970s, frequently giving nods to old school disco, soul and jazz.</p>
<p>As a remixer, he has worked for a diverse range of artists includingThe Beloved, The Human League, Ricky Martin, Boris Dlugosch, Modjo, DJ Sneak and RÃ¶yksopp. After a brief hiatus, he has recently returned to production, remixing artists like Rosie Brown and Truman Industries.
Carter was recently named #66 in the 100 Most Famous Chicagoans according to a survey (relying mostly on Google hits) by the free weekly newspaper, New City (11/2006), finishing just between syndicated radio show host Tom Joyner(#65) and Chicago Cubs player, Carlos Zambrano(#67). Other house music artists making the cut included Felix da Housecat (#21) and Frankie Knuckles(#48).</p>
