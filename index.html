      <h2>Welcome to the House Music Database</h2>
      <p>Here at <strong>HMDB</strong>, we strive to be housekeepers. The ones who maintain a recorded history of the music that we cherish, and that has spawned a worldwide love for all things house. Not everyone understands house music. It's a <em>spiritual</em> thing. A <em>body</em> thing. A <em>soul</em> thing.</p><br>
      <p>House music is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in the American city of Chicago in the early 1980s. It was initially popularized circa 1984 in Chicago, but beginning in 1985, it fanned out to other major cities such as Baltimore, Detroit, Toronto, Mexico City, New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Montreal, Canc√∫n, Manchester, Miami, London and Paris. Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide.<p>
